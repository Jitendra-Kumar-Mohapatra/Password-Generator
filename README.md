# Password-Generator

This program takes the input from the user like total password length, min uppercase, min lowercase, min digits & min special char and then use random, secrets library module to generate the unique and strong password.

# Python Library

1. Random:
Python Random module is an in-built module of Python which is used to generate random numbers. These are pseudo-random numbers means these are not truly random. This module can be used to perform random actions such as generating random numbers, print random a value for a list or string, etc.

Example: Printing a random value from a list

2. Strings:
Python String module contains some constants, utility function, and classes for string manipulation.

3. Secrets:
The secrets module is design for cryptography - it generates robust random numbers 
which almost certainly do not use the 'mersene twister' generator that the random module 
uses by default. Also the functions in the secrets module are design for generation of 
secret keys, urls etc, whereas the functions in the random module are designed for shuffling data etc.
